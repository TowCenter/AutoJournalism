Status Quo
 ----------
 
 ### Market phase 

 -   Companies worldwide are developing software solutions for generating     automated news. 

 -   Leading media companies such as the Associated Press, *Forbes*, *The     New York Times*, *Los Angeles Times*, and ProPublica have started to     automate news content. 

 -   Although the technology is still in an early market phase, automated     journalism has arrived in newsrooms and is likely here to stay. 

 ### Conditions and drivers 

 -   Automated journalism is most useful in generating routine news     stories for repetitive topics for which clean, accurate, and     structured data are available. 

 -   Automated journalism cannot be used to cover topics for which no     structured data are available and is challenging when data quality     is poor. 

 -   The key drivers of automated journalism are an ever-increasing     availability of structured data, as well as news organizations’ aim     to both cut costs and increase the quantity of news. 

 ### Potential 

 -   Algorithms are able to generate news faster, at a larger scale, and     potentially with fewer errors than human journalists. 

 -   Algorithms can use the same data to tell stories in multiple     languages and from different angles, thus personalizing them to an     individual reader’s preferences. 

 -   Algorithms have the potential to generate news on demand by creating     stories in response to users’ questions about the data. 

 ### Limitations 

 -   Algorithms rely on data and assumptions, both of which are subject     to biases and errors. As a result, algorithms could produce outcomes     that were unexpected, unintended, and contain errors. 

 -   Algorithms cannot ask questions, explain new phenomena, or establish     causality and are thus limited in their ability to observe society     and to fulfill journalistic tasks, such as orientation and public     opinion formation. 

 -   The writing quality of automated news is inferior to human writing     but likely to improve, especially as natural language generation     technology advances.
