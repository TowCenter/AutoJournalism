Key Questions and Implications
 ------------------------------
 
 ### For journalists 

 -   Human and automated journalism will likely become closely integrated     and form a “man-machine marriage.” 

 -   Journalists are best advised to develop skills that algorithms     cannot perform, such as in-depth analysis, interviewing, and     investigative reporting. 

 -   Automated journalism will likely replace journalists who merely     cover routine topics, but will also generate new jobs within the     development of news-generating algorithms. 

 ### For news consumers 

 -   People rate automated news as more credible than human-written news     but do not particularly enjoy reading automated content. 

 -   Automated news is currently most suited for topics where providing     facts in a quick and efficient way is more important than     sophisticated narration, or where news did not exist previously and     consumers thus have low expectations regarding the quality of the     writing. 

 -   Little is known about news consumers’ demand for algorithmic     transparency, such as whether they need (or want) to understand how     algorithms work. 

 ### For news organizations 

 -   Since algorithms cannot be held accountable for errors, liability     for automated content will rest with a natural person (e.g., the     journalist or the publisher). 

 -   Algorithmic transparency and accountability will become critical     when errors occur, in particular when covering controversial topics     and/or personalizing news. 

 -   Apart from basic guidelines that news organizations should follow     when automatically generating news, little is known about which     information should be made transparent regarding how the algorithms     work. 

 ### For society 

 -   Automated journalism will substantially increase the amount of     available news, which will further increase people’s burden to find     content that is most relevant to them. 

 -   An increase in automated—and, in particular, personalized—news is     likely to reemphasize concerns about potential fragmentation of     public opinion. 

 -   Little is known about potential implications for democracy if     algorithms are to take over part of journalism’s role as a watchdog     for government.
